**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Prasham Patel

Time spent: **5-6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
W3schools and Stack Overflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One of the main challenges I faced was making a random pattern upon each game start. Js does not have a truly random number generator and with the one that is does have,
it olnly chooses between numbers 0 through 1. To overcome this, I used a for loop to build the patttern array up to 7 indexes and used Math.Random to generate a number in the desried range,
then populated the pattern array for the game to play from. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How can I now develop a backend with a database system to hold user scores and display highest scorers. Also, I tried to play with the playback speed but it essentially broke my game, so
I'd like to also learn how to implement that. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had additional time to complete this project, I would explore css and js animations to make the webpage cooler and more dynamic. I have always been interested in dynamicness and reactivity.
Allowing a user to interact with a page is one thing, but sending back reactions is a whole other story. For example on our phones we have haptic feedback and vibrations,
however on a laptop or pc we are not able to make these reactions, therefore by using css and js tricks we can increase dynamicness and interactiveness.
